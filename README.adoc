# Build Your Custom Migration Application

In this example the Acme Inc. has a custom library `seclib-core`.
A new release was made and current version is 6.0.0.
Now all teams using v5 must upgrade to v6 ASAP.

Unfortunately all teams are under heavy load.
Thus, the `seclib-core` team decided to provide a migration tool `seclib-upgrade-v5-v6`.
This tool will automatically upgrade applications from v5 to v6.

The `business-service` team then wants to use the tool to upgrade their code to use `seclib-core` v6.

Prerequisites:

* `sbm-core:0.14.0-SNAPSHOT` exists in local Maven repo
* `seclib-core:5.0.0` and `seclib-core:6.0.0` exist in local Maven repo

Required Steps:

**seclib-core**

* Maven install `seclib-core:5.0.0` and `seclib-core:6.0.0`

**seclib-upgrade-v5-v6**

Implementing the migration tool

* Add dependency to `sbm-core`
* Create recipe
** Update `seclib-core` version
** Remove deprecated code
** Add annotation
* Create Spring Boot CLI application

**business-service**

* runs the migration application to upgrade to `seclib-core:6.0.0`

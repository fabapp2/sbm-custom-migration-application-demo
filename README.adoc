# Build Your Custom Migration Application

In this example the Acme Inc. has a custom library `seclib-core`.
A new release was made and current version is 6.0.0.
Now all teams using v5 must upgrade to v6 ASAP.

Unfortunately all teams are under heavy load.
Thus, the `seclib-core` team decided to provide a migration tool `sbm-seclib-upgrade-v5-v6`.
This tool will automatically upgrade applications from v5 to v6.

The `business-service` team then wants to use the tool to upgrade their code to use `seclib-core` v6.
